## Business Understanding
### Current Situation 
The movie business has been growing fast during the last decade and with the appearance of streaming services, movies are becoming reachable to everybody. The competition is tough so only a few new movie studios succeed.

We have researched on different movie databases (that will be discussed in detail later), analyzed important metrics and found patterns with the help of statistics. 
As a data-driven team, we take decisions based on facts and we want to share this philosophy with CV. 

## Data Understanding Analysis 
The source of the data has come from many different areas. These different datasets include:
	• Box Office Moji

The data from the sources is very succinct and valuable.  There are many possibilities and comparisons that can be done. Just a few categories include directors, producers, reviews, genres,  ratings, studios, theatre date, revenue, etc.

When one thinks of a movie the first thoughts that populate are who is being cast, who is putting it together, and what is the overarching theme?  To find the answer to these questions we will explore the data. 

### Who should be cast?

Out of the actors and actresses with the greatest number of reviews, we will order them to depict our top to least favorites.
